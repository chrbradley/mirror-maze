1. Open $ARGUMENTS and identify any prompts not marked as completed.

2. For each incomplete prompt:
    - Double-check if it's truly unfinished (if uncertain, ask for clarification).
    - If you confirm it's already done, skip it.
    - Otherwise, implement it as described.
    - Write simple, clean, maintainable, idiomatic solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
    - Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
    - run linting on the changed files
    - run code formatting on the changed files
    - validate TypeScript on the changed files if needed.

3. After you finish each prompt, get feed back from the user:
    - summarize changes made
    - summarize new expected behavior
    - provide manual testing instructions if applicable
    - ask the user to run the app and  confirm application is building and working as expected
    - if they confirm, continue

4. After user confirms application is functioning as expected.
    - Update $ARGUMENTS to mark this prompt as completed.
    - Update **@.claude-plan/todo.md** to mark the associated todos as complete.
    - Commit the changes to your repository with a clear commit message.
      - never include generated by or co-authored claude code or anthropic
      - the commit message should not include the line  "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)"
      - the commit message should not include the line "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

5. Ask the user if you should continue or do something else.
