# Mirror Maze Implementation Progress

## Completed Steps âœ…

1. **Step 1: Project Initialization and Basic p5.js Setup** âœ…
   - Initialized Vite + TypeScript project
   - Installed p5.js and @types/p5
   - Set up canvas with p5.js instance mode
   - Note: Canvas size increased to 1280x600 to accommodate larger rooms

2. **Step 2: Retro Vector Theme System** âœ…
   - Created theme.ts with color constants
   - Added stroke weights (including EXTRA_THICK for "on" state)
   - Implemented helper drawing functions

3. **Step 3: Basic Grid Rendering** âœ…
   - Created 2x5 grid with cyan borders
   - Room size doubled to 240x240 (per user request)
   - Added room indices in corners

4. **Step 4: Room Coordinate System** âœ…
   - Implemented coordinate transformation system
   - Created roomToCanvas and canvasToRoom functions
   - Tested with click detection

5. **Step 5: Mirror Point Transformation** âœ…
   - Implemented mirrorPoint function
   - Created getMirroredRoomPoint for room-based mirroring
   - Tested with F shape visualization

6. **Step 6: Entity Base Classes** âœ…
   - Created Entity base class with position tracking
   - Implemented ObjectEntity (triangle) and ReceptorEntity (circle)
   - Added EntityManager for tracking all entities

7. **Step 7: Dragging System for Sandbox** âœ…
   - Implemented DragManager for mouse interactions
   - Entities can only be dragged in home room (0,0)
   - Added hover highlights for draggable entities

8. **Step 8: Mirror Wall System** âœ…
   - Created Mirror class with three states: disabled, off, on
   - Visual states: disabled (thin), off (medium), on (extra thick)
   - Top row: North walls always disabled, South walls toggleable
   - Bottom row: South walls always disabled, North walls toggleable
   - All East and West walls are toggleable (for hard puzzles)

## Remaining Steps ðŸ“‹

9. **Step 9: UI Controls** âœ…
   - Created src/ui/controls.ts
   - Added bounce count slider (0-5) below the grid
   - Styled slider with retro theme
   - Added visual indicator showing current bounce value
   - Created mode switcher between Sandbox and Challenge
   - Implemented "Fire!" button (disabled in sandbox mode)
   - Canvas height increased to 720px to accommodate controls

10. **Step 10: Ray-Line Intersection** âœ…
    - Created src/core/geometry.ts
    - Defined Ray type with origin and direction
    - Defined LineSegment type for walls
    - Implemented rayLineIntersection using parametric equations
    - Created getRoomWallSegments for active mirrors
    - Added getAllActiveWallSegments for full grid
    - Handled edge cases (parallel rays, epsilon tolerance)

11. **Step 11: Method of Images Algorithm** âœ…
    - Created src/core/raytrace.ts
    - Implemented computeVirtualTarget function to reflect receptor through mirrors
    - Implemented computeReflectionPath function to trace ray paths
    - Added path validation to ensure correct mirror usage
    - Handles multi-bounce reflections with proper physics

12. **Step 12: Ray Visualization**
    - Neon green ray rendering
    - Real-time preview in sandbox
    - Dashed line to virtual image

13. **Step 13: Challenge Mode Structure**
    - Challenge definitions
    - ChallengeManager
    - Preset positions

14. **Step 14: Fire and Hit Detection**
    - Ray path verification
    - Success/failure animations
    - Completion tracking

15. **Step 15: Animations and Feedback**
    - Ray travel animation
    - Pulse effects
    - Screen shake

16. **Step 16: Accessibility and Polish**
    - ARIA labels
    - Keyboard navigation
    - Focus indicators

17. **Step 17: Final Integration and Optimization**
    - Performance optimization
    - Bundle size check
    - Deployment

## Notes

- Room size was doubled from 120x120 to 240x240 per user request
- Canvas size adjusted to 1280x600 to accommodate larger rooms
- Mirror visual states updated for better clarity
- All outer walls can be toggled (for hard puzzle support)
