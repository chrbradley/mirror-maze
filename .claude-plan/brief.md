# Brief: Reflection

Each and every point on the surface of an illuminated object constantly reflects rays of light that spread in all directions. A few of these rays make it into our eyes, which do all the hard work of assembling the rays from many points to generate the image that we see. When you see yourself in the mirror, the light bouncing off you is reflecting back to your eyes.

This is all built from a simple rule: when a ray of light encounters a surface, the angles that the incoming and outgoing light make with the surface are equal. This is pretty straightforward, but things start to get more interesting when light is reflected more than once. Images of nearby objects can even appear far away, and if you've ever put two mirrors in the same room, you know that when the angle is just right, you can peer into an infinite abyss. 

For this interactive, we want to help learners discover that images in mirrors have definite locations that can be found by geometric reasoning ‚Äî particularly cases where there are two mirrors and infinite reflections can form.

By ‚Äúgeometric reasoning,‚Äù we mean that understanding the positions of objects will help you predict where their reflections should be. For example:

- How does the position of an object in a room correspond with where you perceive its virtual image in the reflections?
- How does the path traveled by the ray change the perceived position of the reflected image?

As the person building the interactive, it may help if we walk through examples and build up to the concept we want to teach.

### Single mirror

Let‚Äôs look at the case of a single flat (not curved) mirror ü™û, an object üî∫¬†and a viewer‚Äôs eye ‚ö´. 

Again, the illuminated object reflects light rays in all directions.

It‚Äôs important to note that the light ray is coming *from* the object *to* the viewer‚Äôs eye (üî∫‚Üí‚ö´), not the other way around. Since we tend to think of ourselves as the viewer (and as the center of action), it‚Äôs often tempting to have a line drawn *out* from the eye to the object, like a laser beam. Don‚Äôt make this mistake! If you animate the ray, or give it any kind of indication of direction, be sure to have it go *to* the eye.

Let‚Äôs start with a case where the viewer (‚ö´) is the object, in front of the mirror. *(The illustrations here depict a top-down view of the viewer, a blue line for the mirror and a faded circle for the image.)* If the eye is looking at its reflection in the mirror, the incoming and outgoing angle of the light will be 90Àö. If the viewer moves closer to the mirror, what would we expect the virtual image to do?

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/85186df3-1fa2-46d2-a153-3439b91c737e/Untitled.png)

It would get closer. If we move further back from the mirror, it would get further away. The distance of the viewer to their virtual image would appear to be twice the distance of the viewer to the mirror surface.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/eb23b622-8cf7-41b3-ae4c-88abf5a1c333/Untitled.png)

If the viewer facing the mirror moved to the right or left, their image in the mirror would move in the same direction. 

To the viewer, it appears that there is a virtual room on the other side of the mirror ‚Äî the positions of everything in the current room, with respect to the mirror, map to the virtual room.

### A virtual room

Now we add an object üî∫¬†to the room. Light rays can travel directly from the object üî∫¬†to the viewer‚Äôs eye ‚ö´, ¬†if the eye is facing the object. 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/ef7a85f6-948d-447e-bd8d-da6bf34f5609/Untitled.png)

The apparent position of the object (the faded object) as seen reflected in the mirror, is as if we took the segment of the light ray from the object to the mirror and flipped it over the mirror.

To the viewer, the reflection appears as a virtual object in a virtual room on the other side of the mirror.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/7ca11205-1896-43c1-bf8e-0dcb3e462e2c/Untitled.png)

If the viewer‚Äôs eye and the object are lined up the same distance from the mirror, then it may seem that the point of reflection is the midpoint between them. But if the viewer or the object move closer to or further from the mirror, this reflection point changes.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/fd5f8a29-21ac-43cd-83b6-457b6cc095e2/Untitled.png)

Thinking of the virtual images seen in a mirror as a *virtual room* helps when an object is not in front of the mirror ‚Äî they‚Äôre still in the virtual room.

### Parallel mirrors

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/323bdfc1-3728-4bdb-8c41-d7b71bfc1889/Untitled.png)

What if the room with the mirror, the viewer, and the object had a *second* mirror on the opposite wall? 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/b068c4bb-d31e-4f97-85f4-c88a1c8c8725/Untitled.png)

Now we create potentially infinite reflections, and infinite virtual rooms. 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/acb1b78c-6552-46d1-ba6c-d8b9fbc5b7d1/Untitled.png)

As before, if an image gets closer to a mirror, its reflection gets closer‚Ä¶ 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/5e6a76b0-46b4-41ea-9f39-76f3ee342348/Untitled.png)

‚Ä¶but also its reflection in the opposite mirror gets further away. It can help to think through how you would expect objects to move in these virtual rooms.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/69605947-09fc-4606-9fc7-fea82a447890/Untitled.png)

Why do we see a series of reflected objects / virtual rooms? With two parallel mirrors, the light rays from the object can travel different paths to the viewer‚Äôs eye. The first virtual room is from the first reflection; the second virtual room is from the second reflection (on the opposite mirror), and so on.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/1031ca95-e180-4ba5-b0bb-4e677bcaf574/Untitled.png)

Unfolding each segment of the light ray to a straight line shows the position and distance at which the virtual object appears to be.

### Constraining the infinite reflections

These virtual rooms extend infinitely in both directions, and as the viewer turns more toward one mirror or another, the light rays reflect back and forth many, many, *many* times to show distant virtual rooms. We may not want our simulation to show *infinite* rooms. How do we constrain these reflections?

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/da73ff9e-d045-439d-abc7-37c7990069f8/Untitled.png)

The answer is in this earlier example.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/054d8769-0777-416f-a614-1266ce2cf5c7/Untitled.png)

We move the viewer so that they are not between both mirrors (either by moving the viewer, or shortening one or both mirrors). This constrains how many virtual rooms and virtual objects can be seen from the viewer‚Äôs vantage point.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/177fb525-9403-4ce5-84c1-063f2b2e9160/Untitled.png)

### Adding a third mirror

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/f759cc6e-169b-4c52-b6e0-e5dddbd39764/Untitled.png)

What happens if we add a mirror on a third wall of the room?

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/433f102a-f6cc-4175-b64d-ba48a5e86f64/Untitled.png)

We would create another set of virtual rooms above this one. Where do you think that the viewer would see objects in these virtual rooms? 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/892fa1e0-ab22-4033-aacf-a928c37925c3/Untitled.png)

You may have predicted the positions of the virtual objects in the virtual rooms. As before, think about how these reflections would move when objects in the room change position. How would you predict where to find a particular reflection by tracing the light rays from the object to the eye?

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/0c8cd663-e412-41bf-9ae5-b1f06848c464/Untitled.png)

As with the two-mirror rooms before, unfolding each segment of the light ray to a straight line shows the position and distance at which the virtual object appears to be.

### Angled walls

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/7791700d-ab9d-4be9-8680-4cf629a2ccb9/Untitled.png)

Thinking about (and calculating) reflections can start to get complicated when you have two mirrors in a corner, as you see above. There are four virtual rooms for two mirrors that are at a 90Àö corner, but what about when the angle is narrower?

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7212d69-4bc9-4c36-9b8a-e8d496e7bf1a/be75511a-8d54-4162-b689-c2cc1a9515bb/Untitled.png)

This scenario can get quickly complicated ‚Äî both confusing to the learner and difficult to calculate or debug in your simulation. We recommend not going down too deeply down this route.

The same situation ‚Äî complicated math, tricky debugging, and potential learner confusion ‚Äî is also true for curved mirrors. We recommend avoiding curved mirrors for this interactive.

## Recap

The main points that are helpful for the learner to discover through exploration of your interactive:

- Understanding how the path the ray of light takes from an object to the eye can help predict where you see it.
- Exploring these concepts when there are multiple mirrors involved (at minimum, two mirrors opposite each other).

Everything else is very open-ended. Please bring questions, ideas, and sketches to the kickoff meeting.
